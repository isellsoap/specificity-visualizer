The *Specificity Visualizer* enables you to identify patterns, trends and inconsistencies across a CSS file in bird‚Äôs-eye view. It‚Äôs especially useful for analyzing big and complex stylesheets. The underlying concept of the [specificity graph](https://csswizardry.com/2014/10/the-specificity-graph/) has been coined by Harry Roberts.

## Features

- üòç It‚Äôs a pretty fun and nice visual experience and potentially changes the way how you look into and think about (your) stylesheets.
- üîç Hover over single data points to see the exact selector or zoom into areas of interest, e.g. you can look at only the selectors of the first half of the file or you can zoom into all selectors with the specificity of `0,2,1` across the entire file.
- üìä To better distinguish different specificity categories the data points are using proper colors and forms. You can also click on a legend item to toggle its visibility, e.g. if you only want to see all ID selectors.
- üì∏Ô∏è Taking screenshots of the chart is great to track progress, e.g. you could save a snapshot of your stylesheet before and after a major refactoring to visualize the difference. Also, you could use it for presentations to effectively communicate to other developers and/or stakeholders.
- üìè Specificities are treated as proper categories on the `y` axis and aren‚Äôt simply ‚Äúadded up‚Äù (after all, no amount of class selectors can overrule an ID selector). Also, selectors inside of `@media`, `@supports` and `@document` blocks are counted, selectors inside of `@keyframes` blocks aren‚Äôt.
